# rfm95-radio
RFM95 LoRa radio module library for arduino

This is based on the radiohead library by mike mcauley.
I extracted out only the items related to the RFM95 and arduino hardware SPI. Greatly simplified things.

Objective was to make easier for new learners to make use of the radio with various arduino platforms without the 
large burden.
